# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending loans to ‘risky’ borrowers is the major source of financial loss for a Lender.
  (which is called as credit default). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
  when the borrower defaults to pay. 
  
  The main objective is to identify these risky loan applicants, 
  then such loans can be reduced. Thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
  Identification of such applicants with the help of EDA is the aim of this case study. 

  The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default,
  i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 
  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
Lending Club is a consumer finance marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers 
who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.

It specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant's profile.

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.

In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. 
In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

The core objective of the excercise is to help the company minimise the credit loss. 
There are two potential sources of credit loss are:

Applicant likely to repay the loan, such an applicant will bring in profit to the company with interest rates.
** Rejecting such applicants will result in loss of business**.
Applicant not likely to repay the loan, i.e. and will potentially default, 
then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss* for the company

# Objectives
The goal is to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA using the given dataset, is the aim of this case study.

If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of 
credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, 
i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

# Dataset
The data given below contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
- Applicants who opted for higher term (60 months) tend to default more than others.
- Applicants who got loan for higher interest rate tend to default more than others.
- Applicants with higher salary mostly applied loans for "home_improvment", "house", "renewable_energy" and "small_businesses"
- Applicants applying for long term has applied for more loan.
